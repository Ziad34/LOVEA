    <center><h4>I just wanted to say thank you for everything thank you for being there for me when i needed, thank you for always supporting me<br>
    thank you for beeing the best friend i have. I'm not good with people and that makes it very hard for me to get with people<br>
but somehow, maybe it was fate, this one day at tulip made my life alot alot alot better<br>
you have no idea how happy you make me, how you always make my day better, how you always make me pause the games to text you.<br>
And i just can't talk enough about this little book you made me, it made me happy like a 4 years old getting candy<br>
it made me think and realize how lucky i am to have you in my life<br>
you became from someone i don't know to someone I will lose anything but not you, i realized that when i saw myslef scared to lose you<<br>
i hope i never lose you, I fr want you always with me, you even became the reason i get mad most of the times when i think<br> that you are mad at me or don't wanna talk to me<br>
that's the reason i get mad most of the times, i overthink alot and when i think that u don't like me, it makes me depressed, 
<br> when you made me this gift you gave me i kept thinking what can i also make for her, i didn't want to buy i wanted to make something by myslef
<br>i kept thinking till i thought of this idea, i wanted something to show how much you mean to me, and thank you for everything you did with and for me<br>
i could never be thankful enough to have roro in my life, thanks for everything. <br>hope we stay together forever
